# Django Todo API Service

This is a simple todo API made with Django without using any REST Frameworks.

## Setup

Download repository source files or clone the repo by using the console:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyOnuoha/django-todo-api.git
```

Navigate the source files folder of our app and open it in the text editor of your choice.

Next, we're going to install and create our virtual environment using a pip package called `virtualenv` by running:

```bash
pip install virtualenv && virtualenv venv
```

After installing our virtual environment, we have to activate it by running:

```bash
# For Linux/Mac -> 

source ./venv/bin/activate

```

```bash
# Windows -> 

venv/Script/activate
```

Next, we're going to install the dependencies for our app by running in the console:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When that's done, we can now run our app in the console:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

If you followed all these steps, then you're all good to go!
